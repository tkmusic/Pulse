# Pulse
An open source interpreted programming language.

## Motivation
Although there are a bunch of new and unused programming languages, I want to make a language that's focused on readability and is perfect for pseudocoding and testing concepts. 

## !! The language is still in development and the core-interpreter has not been developt yet. If you want, you can still take a look an the project. :) !!
